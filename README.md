- Stardom - A planet hopping 2D/3D adventure rpg, as you in search of "Eden" - A mythical super-race that may or may not,
hold the key to the rest of the universes survival. But probably not in the way you would expect.

- Engine Features

  - 2D Scene Graph, with automatic shadow mapping and lighting.
  - A fast optimized particle system.
