- Starmdom is comprised of two seperate projects.

  - Stardom Engine - This is a 2D(Soon to include 3D elements) engine that will power "Stardom"

  - Stardom - A planet hopping 2D/3D adventure rpg, as you in search of "Eden" - A mythical super-race that may or may not, hold the key to the rest of the universes survival. But probably not in the way you would expect.

  - 2D Scene Graph, with automatic shadow mapping and lighting.
  - A fast optimized particle system.
